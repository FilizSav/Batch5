        Requirement:
        Write a Java program that asks user to enter 2
        numbers(number1 and number2) and store those in int
        variables.
        Find the result of number1/number2 and store this in a
        double.
        Finally, print the result
        Test data:
        Number1 = 15
        Number2 = 2
        Expected Output:
        7.5
        NOTE: 7.5 is a double or float but you are asked to store
        the result in a double. Make sure that your result is not
        returning 7 instead of 7.5
        NOTE: expected results should exactly match!!!
